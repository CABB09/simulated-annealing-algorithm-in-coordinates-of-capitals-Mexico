# simulated-annealing-algorithm-in-coordinates-of-capitals-Mexico
Over time, new algorithms have been developed that can fulfill their goal and that is to find an optimal solution to a problem. In this case, the simulated annealing algorithm will be used to find the best route in the path of traversing all the capitals of the Mexican Republic and CDMX
