# simulated-annealing-algorithm-in-coordinates-of-capitals-Mexico
Over time, new algorithms have been developed that can fulfill their goal and that is to find an optimal solution to a problem. In this case, the simulated annealing algorithm will be used to find the best route in the path of traversing all the capitals of the Mexican Republic and CDMX that is, applying this algorithm to the traveler's problem, a well-known problem in AI due to its simplicity and ease of explanation in many algorithms.

This project was done for the subject "Algorithm Analysis" of the master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Universidad Veracruzana.
